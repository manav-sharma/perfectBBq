THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SETTINGS FOR CMS EDITOR:-

1. For ADDING THE NEW PLUGIN, FOLLOWING STEPS NEEDS TO BE FOLLOW:-

	-  JUST COPY THAT PLUGIN AND PASTE IT IN CMS_MANAGER/CMS_EDITOR/PLUGINS/

	-  AND ALSO MAKE THE NEW ENTRY OF THAT PARTICULAR PLUGIN IN JS.PHP file.

	 (For example, if you want to add a new plugin "table" then just copy the table plugin and paste it in plugin folder and 
	 make the entry of table plugin in js.php)


2. FOR REMOVE THE PLUGIN FROM THE EDITOR, FOLLOWING STEPS NEEDS TO BE FOLLOW:-

	- Just remove that particular plugin folder from CMS_MANAGER/CMS_EDITOR/PLUGINS/ and also remove the entry of plugin from js.php file.



3. FOR REMOVE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FROM CMS EDITOR, THE FOLLOWING STEPS NEEDS TO BE FOLLOW:-

	- WHICHEVER OPTION YOU WANT TO REMOVE FROM THE EDITOR, JUST DELETE THOSE OPTIONS FROM JS.PHP FILE.

	  (FOR EXAMPLES IF YOU WANT TO REMOVE THE BOLD ITEM FROM THE EDITOR THEN JUST DELETE IT FROM theme_advanced_buttons1

	 SIMILARLY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE MORE THAN 3 OPTIONS IN THE EDITOR THEN JUST DELETE THE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FROM 
	 theme_advanced_buttons2 AND theme_advanced_buttons3 RESPECTIVELY AND REMAIN theme_advanced_buttons2 AND theme_advanced_buttons3 AS EMPTY STRING.)
 

4. FOR ADDING THE ADDITIONAL OPTIONS FOR CMS EDITOR,THE FOLLOWING STEPS NEEDS TO BE FOLLOW:-

	- WHICHEVER OPTION YOU WANT TO ADD FOR THE EDITOR, JUST TYPE THAT OPTION IN state controls like theme_advanced_buttons1(for 1st row),
	 or in theme_advanced_buttons2(for 2nd row)  or in theme_advanced_buttons3(for 3rd row) or theme_advanced_buttons4(for 4th row)	

	 (e.g. if i want to add undo,redo for simple editor in 2nd row, then i have to type for theme_advanced_buttons2:"undo,|,redo" 


5. FOR CHANGING THE TOOLBAR LOCATION

Note:- All the changes for cms editor, will be implemented from js.php file. If we change in js.php file, it will leave it's own impact on cms editor.
(we can make the cms as advanced or we can make the cms as basic or simple from js.php file)
